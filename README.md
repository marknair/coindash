# coindash
This is the coindash project, and it's full of:
- collision shapes
- messages
- audio
- tweening
- timers

The idea is a player node collects randomly instantiated coin nodes. When the player collects all the coins, the player goes to the next level. Coins increase by the level + extra coins for every level. When the timer runs down, the game ends.
